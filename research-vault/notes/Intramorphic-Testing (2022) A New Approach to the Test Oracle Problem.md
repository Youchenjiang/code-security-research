The Oracle Problem in Software
Testing: A Survey
Earl T. Barr, Mark Harman, Phil McMinn, Muzammil Shahbaz, and Shin Yoo
Abstract— Testing involves examining the behaviour of a system in order to discover potential faults. Given an input for a system,
the challenge of distinguishing the corresponding desired, correct behaviour from potentially incorrect behavior is called the “test
oracle problem”. Test oracle automation is important to remove a current bottleneck that inhibits greater overall test automation.
Without test oracle automation, the human has to determine whether observed behaviour is correct. The literature on test oracles
has introduced techniques for oracle automation, including modelling, speciﬁcations, contract-driven development and metamorphic
testing. When none of these is completely adequate, the ﬁnal source of test oracle information remains the human, who may be
aware of informal speciﬁcations, expectations, norms and domain speciﬁc information that provide informal oracle guidance. All
forms of test oracles, even the humble human, involve challenges of reducing cost and increasing beneﬁt. This paper provides a
comprehensive survey of current approaches to the test oracle problem and an analysis of trends in this important area of software
testing research and practice.

UCH work on software testing seeks to automate as
much of the test process as practical and desirable,
to make testing faster, cheaper, and more reliable. To
this end, we need a test oracle, a procedure that distin-
guishes between the correct and incorrect behaviors of
the System Under Test (SUT).
However, compared to many aspects of test automation,
the problem of automating the test oracle has received signif-
icantly less attention, and remains comparatively less well-
solved. This current open problem represents a signiﬁcant
bottleneck that inhibits greater test automation and uptake
of automated testing methods and tools more widely. For
instance, the problem of automatically generating test inputs
has been the subject of research interest for nearly four deca-
des [46], [107]. It involves ﬁnding inputs that cause execution
to reveal faults, if they are present, and to give conﬁdence in
their absence, if none are found. Automated test input gener-
ation been the subject of many signiﬁcant advances in both
Search-Based Testing [3], [5], [83], [126], [128] and Dynamic
Symbolic Execution [75], [108], [161]; yet none of these
advances address the issue of checking generated inputs
with respect to expected behaviours—that is, providing an
automated solution to the test oracle problem.
Of course, one might hope that the SUT has been devel-
oped under excellent design-for-test principles, so that there
might be a detailed, and possibly formal, speciﬁcation of
intended behaviour. One might also hope that the code
itself contains pre- and post- conditions that implement
well-understood contract-driven development approaches
[135]. In these situations, the test oracle cost problem is ame-
liorated by the presence of an automatable test oracle to
which a testing tool can refer to check outputs, free from the
need for costly human intervention.
Where no full speciﬁcation of the properties of the SUT
exists, one may hope to construct a partial test oracle that
can answer questions for some inputs. Such partial test
oracles can be constructed using metamorphic testing
(built from known relationships between desired behav-
iour) or by deriving oracular information from execution
or documentation.
For many systems and most testing as currently practiced
in industry, however, the tester does not have the luxury of
formal speciﬁcations or assertions, or automated partial test
oracles [91], [92]. The tester therefore faces the daunting task
of manually checking the system’s behaviour for all test
cases. In such cases, automated software testing approaches
must address the human oracle cost problem [1], [82], [130].
To achieve greater test automation and wider uptake of
automated testing, we therefore need a concerted effort to
ﬁnd ways to address the test oracle problem and to integrate
automated and partially automated test oracle solutions
into testing techniques. This paper seeks to help address
this challenge by providing a comprehensive review and
analysis of the existing literature of the test oracle problem.
Four partial surveys of topics relating to test oracles pre-
cede this one. However, none has provided a comprehen-
sive survey of trends and results. In 2001, Baresi and Young
[17] presented a partial survey that covered four topics
prevalent at the time the paper was published: assertions,
speciﬁcations, state-based conformance testing, and log ﬁle
analysis. While these topics remain important, they capture
only a part of the overall landscape of research in test

oracles, which the present paper covers. Another early work
was the initial motivation for considering the test oracle
problem contained in Binder’s textbook on software testing
[23], published in 2000. More recently, in 2009, Shahamiri
et al. [164] compared six techniques from the speciﬁc cate-
gory of derived test oracles. In 2011, Staats et al. [174] pro-
posed a theoretical analysis that included test oracles in a
revisitation of the fundamentals of testing. Most recently, in
2014, Pezz /C18e and Zhang focus on automated test oracles for
functional properties [150].
Despite this work, research into the test oracle problem
remains an activity undertaken in a fragmented community
of researchers and practitioners. The role of the present
paper is to overcome this fragmentation in this important
area of software testing by providing the ﬁrst comprehen-
sive analysis and review of work on the test oracle problem.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 sets
out the deﬁnitions relating to test oracles that we use to com-
pare and contrast the techniques in the literature. Section 3
relates a historical analysis of developments in the area. Here
we identify key milestones and track the volume of past pub-
lications. Based on this data, we plot growth trends for four
broad categories of solution to the test oracle problem, which
we survey in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7. These four categories
comprise approaches to the oracle problem where:
/C15 test oracles can be speciﬁed (Section 4);
/C15 test oracles can be derived (Section 5);
/C15 test oracles can be built from implicit information
(Section 6); and
/C15 no automatable oracle is available, yet it is still possible
to reduce human effort (Section 7).
Finally, Section 8 concludes with closing remarks.
2D EFINITIONS
This section presents deﬁnitions to establish a lingua franca
in which to examine the literature on oracles. These deﬁni-
tions are formalised to avoid ambiguity, but the reader
should ﬁnd that it is also possible to read the paper using
only the informal descriptions that accompany these formal
deﬁnitions. We use the theory to clarify the relationship
between algebraic speciﬁcation, pseudo oracles, and meta-
morphic relations in Section 5.
To begin, we deﬁne a test activity as a stimulus or
response, then test activity sequences that incorporate con-
straints over stimuli and responses. Test oracles accept or
reject test activity sequences, ﬁrst deterministically then
probabilistically. We then deﬁne notions of soundness and
completeness of test oracles.
2.1 Test Activities
To test is to stimulate a system and observe its response. A
stimulus and a response both have values, which may coin-
cide, as when the stimulus value and the response are both
reals. A system has a set of components C. A stimulus and its
response target a subset of components. For instance, a com-
mon pattern for constructing test oracles is to compare the
output of distinct components on the same stimulus value.
Thus, stimuli and responses are values that target compo-
nents. Collectively, stimuli and responses are test activities:
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Test Activities). For the SUT p, S is the set of
stimuli that trigger or constrain p’s computation and R is the
set of observable responses to a stimulus of p. S and R are dis-
joint. Test activities form the set A ¼ S ] R.
The use of disjoint union implicitly labels the elements of
A, which we can ﬂatten to the tuple L /C2 C /C2 V , where
L ¼f stimulus; responseg is the set of activities labels, C is
the set of components, and V is an arbitrary set of values.
To model those aspects of the world that are independent of
any component, like a clock, we set an activity’s target to
the empty set.
We use the terms “stimulus” and “observation” in the
broadest sense possible to cater to various testing scenarios,
functional and nonfunctional. As shown in Fig. 1, a stimulus
can be either an explicit test input from the tester,I /C26 S,o ra n
environmental factor that can affect the testing,S n I.S i m i l a r l y ,
an observation ranges from an output of the SUT, O /C26 R,t oa
nonfunctional execution proﬁle, like execution time inR n O.
For example, stimuli include the conﬁguration and plat-
form settings, database table contents, device states, resource
constraints, preconditions, typed values at an input device,
inputs on a channel from another system, sensor inputs and
so on. Notably, resetting a SUT to an initial state is a stimulus
and stimulating the SUT with an input runs it. Observations
include anything that can be discerned and ascribed a mean-
ing signiﬁcant to the purpose of testing—including values
that appear on an output device, database state, temporal
properties of the execution, heat dissipated during execution,
power consumed, or any other measurable attributes of its
execution. Stimuli and observations are members of different
sets of test activities, but we combine them into test activities.
2.2 Test Activity Sequence
Testing is a sequence of stimuli and response observations.
The relationship between stimuli and responses can often
be captured formally; consider a simple SUT that squares
its input. To compactly represent inﬁnite relations between
stimulus and response values such as ði; o ¼ i2Þ, we intro-
duce a compact notation for set comprehensions:
x: ½f/C138¼f x j fg;
where x is a dummy variable over an arbitrary set.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Test Activity Sequence). A test activity
sequence is an element of TA ¼f w j T !
/C3
wg over the
grammar
Fig. 1. Stimulus and observations: S is anything that can change the
observable behavior of the SUT f; R is anything that can be observed
about the system’s behavior;I includes f’s explicit inputs;O is its explicit
outputs; everything not in S [ R neither affects nor is affected by f.

T ::¼ A0: ½0f0/C1380T j AT j /C15
where A is the test activity alphabet.
Under Deﬁnition 2.2, the testing activity sequence
io:½o ¼ i2/C138 denotes the stimulus of invoking f on i,t h e n
observing the response output . It further speciﬁes valid
responses obeying o ¼ i2. Thus, it compactly represents
the inﬁnite set of test activity sequences i1o1;i 2o2; ...
where ok ¼ i2
k.
For practical purposes, a test activity sequence will
almost always have to satisfy constraints in order to be use-
ful. Under our formalism, these constraints differentiate the
approaches to test oracle we survey. As an initial illustra-
tion, we constrain a test activity sequence to obtain a practi-
cal test sequence:
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Practical Test Sequence). A practical test
sequence is any test activity sequence w that satisﬁes
w ¼ TsTrT; for s 2 S; r 2 R:
Thus, the test activity sequence, w,i s practical iff w con-
tains at least one stimulus followed by at least one
observation.
This notion of a test sequence is nothing more than a very
general notion of what it means to test; we must do some-
thing to the system (the stimulus) and subsequently observe
some behaviour of the system (the observation) so that we
have something to check (the observation) and something
upon which this observed behaviour depends (the stimulus).
A reliable reset ðp; rÞ2 S is a special stimulus that returns
the SUT’s component p to its start state. The test activity
sequence ðstimulus; p; rÞðstimulus; p;i Þ is therefore equivalent
to the conventional application notation pðiÞ. To extract the
value of an activity, we write vðaÞ; to extract its target compo-
nent, we write cðaÞ. To specify two invocations of a single
component on the different values, we must write r1i1r2;i 2 :
½r1;i 1; r2;i 2 2 S; cðr1Þ¼ cði1Þ¼ cðr2Þ¼ cði2Þ^ vði1Þ 6¼ vði2Þ/C138.
In the sequel, we often compare different executions of a sin-
gle SUT or compare the output of independently imple-
mented components of the SUT on the same input value. For
clarity, we introduce syntactic sugar to express constraints on
stimulus values and components. We let fðxÞ denote ri :
½cðiÞ¼ f ^ vðiÞ¼ x/C138,f o rf 2 C.
A test oracle is a predicate that determines whether a
given test activity sequence is an acceptable behaviour of
the SUT or not. We ﬁrst deﬁne a “test oracle”, and then relax
this deﬁnition to “probabilistic test oracle”.
Deﬁnition 2.4 (Test Oracle). A test oracle D : TA 7! B is a
partial1 function from a test activity sequence to true or false.
When a test oracle is deﬁned for a test activity, it either
accepts the test activity or not. Concatenation in a test activ-
ity sequence denotes sequential activities; the test oracle D
permits parallel activities when it accepts different permu-
tations of the same stimuli and response observations. We
use D to distinguish a deterministic test oracle from proba-
bilistic ones. Test oracles are typically computationally
expensive, so probabilistic approaches to the provision of
oracle information may be desirable even where a determin-
istic test oracle is possible [124].
Deﬁnition 2.5 (Probabilistic Test Oracle). A probabilistic
test oracle ~D : TA 7!½ 0; 1/C138maps a test activity sequence into
the interval ½0; 1/C1382 R.
A probabilistic test oracle returns a real number in the
closed interval ½0; 1/C138. As with test oracles, we do not require
a probabilistic test oracle to be a total function. A

and y-axis the cumulative number of publications. We use a power regression model to perform the trend analysis. The regression equation and the

its domain to a single element of its range. The partial function

probabilistic test oracle can model the case where the test
oracle is only able to efﬁciently offer a probability that
the test case is acceptable, or for other situations where
some degree of imprecision can be tolerated in the test
oracle’s response.
Our formalism combines a language-theoretic view of
stimulus and response activities with constraints over those
activities; these constraints explicitly capture speciﬁcations.
The high-level language view imposes a temporal order on
the activities. Thus, our formalism is inherently temporal. The
formalism of Staats et al. captures any temporal exercising of
the SUT’s behavior in tests, which are atomic black boxes for
them [174]. Indeed, practitioners write test plans and activi-
ties, they do not often write speciﬁcations at all, let alone a for-
mal one. This fact and the expressivity of our formalism, as
evident in our capture of existing test oracle approaches, is
evidence that our formalism is a good ﬁt with practice.
2.3 Soundness and Completeness
We conclude this section by deﬁning soundness and com-
pleteness of test oracles.
In order to deﬁne soundness and completeness of a test
oracle, we need to deﬁne a concept of the “ground truth”, G.
The ground truth is another form of oracle, a conceptual
oracle, that always gives the “right answer”. Of course, it
cannot be known in all but the most trivial cases, but it is a
useful deﬁnition that bounds test oracle behaviour.
Deﬁnition 2.6 (Ground Truth). The ground truth oracle , G,
is a total test oracle that always gives the “right answer”.
We can now deﬁne soundness and completeness of a test
oracle with respect to G.
Deﬁnition 2.7 (Soundness). The test oracle D is sound iff
DðaÞ)G ð aÞ:
Deﬁnition 2.8 (Completeness). The test oracle D is complete
iff
GðaÞ) DðaÞ:
While test oracles cannot, in general, be both sound and
complete, we can, nevertheless, deﬁne and use partially cor-
rect test oracles. Further, one could argue, from a purely
philosophical point of view, that human oracles can be
sound and complete, or correct. In this view, correctness
becomes a subjective human assessment. The foregoing def-
initions allow for this case.
We relax our deﬁnition of soundness to cater for probabi-
listic test oracles:
Deﬁnition 2.9 (Probablistic Soundness and Completeness).
A probabilistic test oracle ~D is probabilistically sound iff
P ð ~DðwÞ¼ 1Þ > 1
2 þ /C15)G ðwÞ
and ~D is probabilistically complete iff
GðwÞ) P ð ~DðwÞ¼ 1Þ > 1
2 þ /C15
where /C15is non-negligible.
The non-negligible advantage /C15 requires ~D to do sufﬁ-
ciently better than ﬂipping a fair coin, which for a binary
classiﬁer maximizes entropy, that we can achieve arbitrary
conﬁdence in whether the test sequence w is valid by repeat-
edly sampling ~D on w.
3T EST ORACLE RESEARCH TRENDS
The term “test oracle” ﬁrst appeared in William Howden’s
seminal work in 1978 [99]. In this section, we analyze the
research on test oracles, and its related areas, conducted
since 1978. We begin with a synopsis of the volume of publi-
cations, classiﬁed into speciﬁed, derived, implicit, and lack
of automated test oracles. We then discuss when key con-
cepts in test oracles were ﬁrst introduced.
3.1 Volume of Publications
We constructed a repository of 694 publications on test
oracles and its related areas from 1978 to 2012 by conduct-
ing web searches for research articles on Google Scholar and
Microsoft Academic Search using the queries “software + test
+ oracle” and “software + test oracle” 2, for each year.
Although some of the queries generated in this fashion may
be similar, different responses are obtained, with particular
differences around more lowly-ranked results.
We classify work on test oracles into four categories:
speciﬁed test oracles (317), derived test oracles (245),
implicit test oracles (76), and no test oracle (56), which han-
dles the lack of a test oracle.
Speciﬁed test oracles, discussed in detail in Section 4,
judge all behavioural aspects of a system with respect to a
given formal speciﬁcation. For speciﬁed test oracles
we searched for related articles using queries “formal +
speciﬁcation”, “state-based speciﬁcation”, “model-based
languages”, “transition-based languages”, “assertion-based
languages”, “algebraic speciﬁcation” and “formal + confor-
mance testing”. For all queries, we appended the keywords
with “test oracle” to ﬁlter the results for test oracles.
Derived test oracles (see Section 5) involve artefacts from
which a test oracle may be derived—for instance, a previous
version of the system. For derived test oracles, we searched
for additional articles using the queries “speciﬁcation
inference”, “speciﬁcation mining”, “API mining”,
“metamorphic testing”, “regression testing” and “program
documentation”.
An implicit oracle (see Section 6) refers to the detection of
“obvious” faults such as a program crash. For implicit test
oracles we applied the queries “implicit oracle”, “null
pointer + detection”, “null reference + detection”, “deadlock
+ livelock + race + detection”, “memory leaks + detection”,
“crash + detection”, “performance + load testing”, “non-
functional + error detection”, “fuzzing + test oracle” and
“anomaly detection”.
There have also been papers researching strategies for
handling the lack of an automated test oracle (see Section 7).
Here, we applied the queries “human oracle”, “test
2. We use + to separate the keywords in a query; a phrase, not inter-
nally separated by +, like “test oracle”, is a compound keyword, quoted
when given to the search engine.

minimization”, “test suite reduction” and “test data + gen-
eration + realistic + valid”.
Each of the above queries were appended by the key-
words “software testing”. The results were ﬁltered,
removing articles that were found to have no relation to
software testing and test oracles. Fig. 2 shows the cumu-
lative number of publications on each type of test oracle
from 1978 onwards. We analyzed the research trend on
this data by applying different regression models. The
trend line, shown in Fig. 2, is ﬁtted using a power
model. The high values for the four coefﬁcients of deter-
mination ( R2), one for each of the four types of test ora-
cle, conﬁrm that our models are good ﬁts to the trend
data. The trends observed suggest a healthy growth in
research volumes in these topics related to the test oracle
problem in the future.
3.2 The Advent of Test Oracle Techniques
We classiﬁed the collected publications by techniques or
concepts they proposed to (partially) solve a test oracle
problem; for example, Model Checking [35] and Metamorphic
Testing [36] fall into the derived test oracle and DAISTIS
[69] is an algebraic speciﬁcation system that addresses the
speciﬁed test oracle problem.
For each type of test oracle and the advent of a tech-
nique or a concept, we plotted a timeline in chronological
order of publications to study research trends. Fig. 3 shows
the timeline starting from 1978 when the term “test oracle”
was ﬁrst coined. Each vertical bar presents the technique
or concept used to solve the problem labeled with the year
of its ﬁrst publication.
The timeline shows only the work that is explicit on the
issue of test oracles. For example, the work on test genera-
tion using ﬁnite state machines (FSM) can be traced back
to as early as 1950s. But the explicit use of ﬁnite state
machines to generate test oracles can be traced back to Jard
and Bochmann [102] and Howden in 1986 [98]. We record,
in the timeline, the earliest available publication for a given
technique or concept. We consider only published work in
journals, the proceedings of conferences and workshops, or
magazines. We excluded all other types of documentation,
such as technical reports and manuals.
Fig. 3 shows a few techniques and concepts that pre-
date 1978. Although not explicitly on test oracles, they
identify and address issues for which test oracles were
later developed. For example, work on detecting concur-
rency issues (deadlock, livelock, and races) can be traced
back to the 1960s. Since these issues require no speciﬁca-
t i o n ,i m p l i c i tt e s to r a c l e sc a na n dh a v eb e e nb u i l tt h a t
detect them on arbitrary systems. Similarly, Regression
Testing detects problems in the functionality a new ver-
sion of a system shares with its predecessors and is a pre-
cursor of derived test oracles.
The trend analysis suggests that proposals for new tech-
niques and concepts for the formal speciﬁcation of test
oracles peaked in 1990s, and has gradually diminished in
the last decade. However, it remains an area of much
research activity, as can be judged from the number of
Fig. 3. Chronological introduction of test oracles techniques and concepts.

publications for each year in Fig. 2. For derived test oracles,
many solutions have been proposed throughout this period.
Initially, these solutions were primarily theoretical, such as
Partial/Pseudo-Oracles [196] and Speciﬁcation Inference
[194]; empirical studies however followed in late 1990s.
For implicit test oracles, research into the solutions estab-
lished before 1978 has continued, but at a slower pace than
the other types of test oracles. For handling the lack of an
automated test oracle, Partition Testing is a well-known tech-
nique that helps a human test oracle select tests. The trend
line suggests that only recently have new techniques and
concepts for tackling this problem started to emerge, with
an explicit focus on the human oracle cost problem.
4S PECIFIED TEST ORACLES
Speciﬁcation is fundamental to computer science, so it is not
surprising that a vast body of research has explored its use as
a source of test oracle information. This topic could merit an
entire survey on its own right. In this section, we provide an
overview of this work. We also include here partial speciﬁca-
tions of system behaviour such as assertions and models.
A speciﬁcation deﬁnes, if possible using mathematical
logic, the test oracle for particular domain. Thus, a speciﬁca-
tion language is a notation for deﬁning a speciﬁed test oracle
D, which judges whether the behaviour of a system con-
forms to a formal speciﬁcation. Our formalism, deﬁned in
Section 2, is, itself, a speciﬁcation language for specifying
test oracles.
Over the last 30 years, many methods and formalisms for
testing based on formal speciﬁcation have been developed.
They fall into four broad categories: model-based speciﬁca-
tion languages, state transition systems, assertions and con-
tracts, and algebraic speciﬁcations. Model-based languages
deﬁne models and a syntax that deﬁnes desired behavior in
terms of its effect on the model. State transition systems
focus on modeling the reaction of a system to stimuli,
referred to as “transitions” in this particular formalism.
Assertions and contracts are fragments of a speciﬁcation
language that are interleaved with statements of the imple-
mentation language and checked at runtime. Algebraic
speciﬁcations deﬁne equations over a program’s operations
that hold when the program is correct.
4.1 Speciﬁcation Languages
Speciﬁcation languages deﬁne a mathematical model of a
system’s behaviour, and are equipped with a formal seman-
tics that deﬁnes the meaning of each language construct in
terms of the model. When used for testing, models do not
usually fully specify the system, but seek to capture salient
properties of a system so that test cases can be generated
from or checked against them.
4.1.1 Model-Based Speciﬁcation Languages
Model-based speciﬁcation languages model a system as a
collection of states and operations to alter these states, and
are therefore also referred to as “state-based speciﬁcations”
in the literature [101], [109], [182], [183]. Preconditions and
postconditions constrain the system’s operations. An oper-
ation’s precondition imposes a necessary condition over the
input states that must hold in a correct application of the
operation; a postcondition deﬁnes the (usually strongest)
effect the operation has on program state [109].
A variety of model-based speciﬁcation languages exist,
including Z [172], B [110], UML/OCL [31], VDM/VDM-SL
[62], Alloy [101], and the LARCH family [71], which
includes an algebraic speciﬁcation sub-language. Broadly,
these languages have evolved toward being more concrete,
closer to the implementation languages programmers use to
solve problems. Two reasons explain this phenomenon: the
ﬁrst is the effort to increase their adoption in industry by
making them more familiar to practitioners and the second
is to establish synergies between speciﬁcation and imple-
mentation that facilitate development as iterative reﬁne-
ment. For instance, Z models disparate entities, like
predicates, sets, state properties, and operations, through a
single structuring mechanism, its schema construct; the B
method, Z’s successor, provides a richer array of less
abstract language constructs.
B€orger discusses how to use the abstract state machine
formalism, a very general set-theoretic speciﬁcation lan-
guage geared toward the deﬁnition of functions, to deﬁne
high level test oracles [29]. The models underlying speciﬁca-
tion languages can be very abstract, quite far from concrete
execution output. For instance, it may be difﬁcult to com-
pute whether a model’s postcondition for a function permits
an observed concrete output. If this impedance mismatch
can be overcome, by abstracting a system’s concrete output
or by concretizing a speciﬁcation model’s output, and if a
speciﬁcation’s postconditions can be evaluated in ﬁnite
time, they can serve as a test oracle [4].
Model-based speciﬁcation languages, such as VDM, Z,
and B can express invariants, which can drive testing. Any
test case that causes a program to violate an invariant has
discovered an incorrect behavior; therefore, these invariants
are partial test oracles.
In search of a model-based speciﬁcation language acces-
sible to domain experts, Parnas et al. proposed TOG (Test
Oracles Generator) from program documentation [142],
[145], [148]. In their method, the documentation is written
in fully formal tabular expressions in which the method sig-
nature, the external variables, and relation between its start
and end states are speciﬁed [104]. Thus, test oracles can be
automatically generated to check the outputs against the
speciﬁed states of a program. The work by Parnas et al. has
been developed over a considerable period of more than
two decades [48], [59], [60], [144], [149], [190], [191].
4.1.2 State Transition Systems
State transition systems often present a graphical syntax,
and focus on transitions between different states of the sys-
tem. Here, states typically abstract sets of concrete state of
the modeled system. State transition systems have been
referred as visual languages in the literature [197]. A wide
variety of state transition systems exist, including ﬁnite state
machines [111], Mealy/Moore machines [111], I/O Autom-
ata [117], Labeled Transition Systems [180], SDL [54], Harel
Statecharts [81], UML state machines [28], X-Machines [95],
[96], Simulink/Stateﬂow [179] and PROMELA [97]. Mou-
chawrab et al. conducted a rigorous empirical evaluation
of test oracle construction techniques using state transition
systems [70], [137].

<!-- Page 7 -->

An important class of state transition systems have a
ﬁnite set of states and are therefore particularly well-suited
for automated reasoning about systems whose behaviour
can be abstracted into states deﬁned by a ﬁnite set of values
[93]. State transition systems capture the behavior of a sys-
tem under test as a set of states, 3 with transitions represent-
ing stimuli that cause the system to change state. State
transition systems model the output of a system they
abstract either as a property of the states (the ﬁnal state in
the case of Moore machines) or the transitions traversed (as
with Mealy machines).
Models approximate a SUT, so behavioral differences
between the two are inevitable. Some divergences, however,
are spurious and falsely report testing failure. State-transition
models are especially susceptible to this problem when
modeling embedded systems, for which time of occurrence is
critical. Recent work model tolerates spurious differences in
time by “steering” model’s evaluation: when the SUT and its
model differ, the model is backtracked, and a steering action,
like modifying timer value or changing inputs, is applied to
reduce the distance, under a similarity measure [74].
Protocol conformance testing [72] and, later, model-
based testing [183] motivated much of the work applying
state transition systems to testing. Given a speciﬁcation F as
a state transition system, e.g. a ﬁnite state machine, a test
case can be extracted from sequences of transitions in F .
The transition labels of such a sequence deﬁne an input. A
test oracle can then be constructed from F as follows: if F
accepts the sequence and outputs some value, then so
should the system under test; if F does not accept the input,
then neither should the system under test.
Challenges remain, however, as the deﬁnition of confor-
mity comes in different ﬂavours, depending on whether
the model is deterministic or non-deterministic and
whether the behaviour of the system under test on a given
test case is observable and can be interpreted at the same
level of abstraction as the model’s. The resulting ﬂavours
of conformity have been captured in alternate notions, in
terms of whether the system under test is isomorphic to,
equivalent to, or quasi-equivalent to F.T h e s en o t i o n so f
conformity were deﬁned in the mid-1990s in the famous
survey paper by Lee and Yannakakis [111] among other
notable papers, including those by Bochmann and
Petrenko [26] and Tretmans [180].
4.2 Assertions and Contracts
An assertion is a boolean expression that is placed at a cer-
tain point in a program to check its behaviour at runtime.
When an assertion evaluates to true, the program’s behav-
iour is regarded “as intended” at the point of the assertion,
for that particular execution; when an assertion evaluates to
false, an error has been found in the program for that partic-
ular execution. It is obvious to see how assertions can be
used as a test oracle.
The fact that assertions are embedded in an implementa-
tion language has two implications that differentiate them
from speciﬁcation languages. First, assertions can directly
reference and deﬁne relations over program variables,
reducing the impedance mismatch between speciﬁcation
and implementation, for the properties an assertion can
express and check. In this sense, assertions are a natural
consequence of the evolution of speciﬁcation languages
toward supporting development through iterative reﬁne-
ment. Second, they are typically written along with the code
whose runtime behavior they check, as opposed to preced-
ing implementation as speciﬁcation languages tend to do.
Assertions have a long pedigree dating back to Turing
[181], who ﬁrst identiﬁed the need to separate the tester
from the developer and suggested that they should commu-
nicate by means of assertions: the developer writing them
and the tester checking them. Assertions gained signiﬁcant
attention as a means of capturing language semantics in the
seminal work of Floyd [64] and Hoare [94] and subse-
quently were championed as a means of increasing code
quality in the development of the contract-based program-
ming approach, notably in the language Eiffel [135].
Widely used programming languages now routinely
provide assertion constructs; for instance, C, C++, and Java
provide a construct called assert and C# provides a Debug.
Assert method. Moreover, a variety of systems have been
independently developed for embedding assertions into a
host programming languages, such as Anna [116] for Ada,
APP [155] and Nana [119] for C languages.
In practice, assertion approaches can check only a limited
set of properties at a certain point in a program [49]. Lan-
guages based on design by contract principles extend the
expressivity of assertions by providing means to check con-
tracts betweenclient and supplier objects in the form of method
pre- and post- conditions and class invariants. Eiffel was the
ﬁrst language to offer design by contract [135], a language fea-
ture that has since found its way into other languages, such as
Java in the form of Java modeling language (JML) [139].
Cheon and Leavens showed how to construct an assertion-
based test oracle on top of JML [45]. For more on assertion-
based test oracles, see Coppit and Haddox-Schatz’s evalua-
tion [49], and, later, a method proposed by Cheon [44]. Both
assertions and contracts are enforced observation activity that
are embedded into the code. Araujo et al. provide a systematic
evaluation of design by contract on a large industrial system
[9] and using JML in particular [8]; Briand et al. showed how
to support testing by instrumenting contracts [33].
4.3 Algebraic Speciﬁcation Languages
Algebraic speciﬁcation languages deﬁne a software module in
terms of its interface, a signature consisting of sorts and opera-
tion symbols. Equational axioms specify the required proper-
ties of the operations; their equivalence is often computed
using term rewriting [15]. Structuring facilities, which group
sorts and operations, allow the composition of interfaces. Typ-
ically, these languages employ ﬁrst-order logic to prove prop-
erties of the speciﬁcation, like the correctness of reﬁnements.
Abstract data types (ADT), which combine data and opera-
tions over that data, are well-suited to algebraic speciﬁcation.
One of the earliest algebraic speciﬁcation systems, for
implementing, specifying and testing ADTs, is DAISTS [69].
In this system, equational axioms generally equate a term-
rewriting expression in a restricted dialect of ALGOL 60
3. Unfortunately, the term ‘state’ has different interpretation in the
context of test oracles. Often, it refers to a ‘snapshot’ of the conﬁgura-
tion of a system at some point during its execution; in context of state
transition systems, however, ‘state’ typically refers to an abstraction of
a set of conﬁgurations, as noted above.
BARR ET AL.: THE ORACLE PROBLEM IN SOFTWARE TESTING: A SURVEY 513

against a function composition in the implementation lan-
guage. For example, consider this axiom used in DAISTS:
Pop2ðStack S; EltType I Þ :
PopðPushðS; IÞÞ ¼ if DepthðSÞ¼ Limit
then PopðSÞ
else S;
This axiom is taken from a speciﬁcation that differentiates
the accessor Top, which returns the top element of a stake
without modifying the stack, and the mutator Pop, which
returns a new stack lacking the previous top element. A test
oracle simply executes both this axiom and its correspond-
ing composition of implemented functions against a test
suite: if they disagree, a failure has been found in the imple-
mentation or in the axiom; if they agree, we gain some
assurance of their correctness.
Gaudel et al. [19], [20], [72], [73] were the ﬁrst to provide
a general testing theory founded on algebraic speciﬁcation.
Their idea is that an exhaustive test suite composed only of
ground terms, i.e., terms with no free variables, would be
sufﬁcient to judge program correctness. This approach faces
an immediate problem: the domain of each variable in a
ground term might be inﬁnite and generate an inﬁnite num-
ber of test cases. Test suites, however, must be ﬁnite, a prac-
tical limitation to which all forms of testing are subject. The
workaround is, of course, to abandon exhaustive coverage
of all bindings of values to ground terms and select a ﬁnite
subset of test cases [20].
Gaudel’s theory focuses on observational equivalence.
Observational inequivalence is, however, equally important
[210]. For this reason, Frankl and Doong extended Gaudel’s
theory to express inequality as well an equality [52]. They
proposed a notation that is suitable for object-oriented pro-
grams and developed an algebraic speciﬁcation language
called LOBAS and a test harness called ASTOOT. In addi-
tion to handling object-orientation, Frankl and Doong
require classes to implement the testing method EQN that
ASTOOT uses to check the equivalence or inequivalence of
two instances of a given class. From the vantage point of an
observer, an object has observable and unobservable, or hid-
den, state. Typically, the observable state of an object is its
public ﬁelds and method return values. EQN enhances the
testability of code and enables ASTOOT to approximate the
observational equivalence of two objects on a sequence of
messages, or method calls. When ASTOOT checks the
equivalence of an object and a speciﬁcation in LOBAS, it
realizes a speciﬁed test oracle.
Expanding upon ASTOOT, Chen et al. [40], [41] built
TACCLE, a tool that employs a white-box heuristic to gener-
ate a relevant, ﬁnite number of test cases. Their heuristic
builds a data relevance graph that connects two ﬁelds of a
class if one affects the other. They use this graph to consider
only that can affect an observable attributes of a class when
considering the (in)equivalence of two instances. Algebraic
speciﬁcation has been a fruitful line of research; many alge-
braic speciﬁcation languages and tools exist, including
Daistish [100], LOFT [122], CASL [11], CASCAT [205]. The
projects have been evolving toward testing a wider array of
entities, from ADTS, to classes, and most recently, compo-
nents; they also differ in their degree of automation of test
case generation and test harness creation. Bochmann et al.
used LOTOS to realise test oracle functions from algebraic
speciﬁcations [184]; most recently, Zhu also considered the
use of algebraic speciﬁcations as test oracles [210].
4.3.1 Speciﬁed Test Oracle Challenges
Three challenges must be overcome to build speciﬁed test
oracles. The ﬁrst is the lack of a formal speciﬁcation. Indeed,
the other classes of test oracles, discussed in this survey, all
address the problem of test oracle construction in the
absence of a formal speciﬁcation. Formal speciﬁcations
models necessarily rely on abstraction that can lead to the
second problem: imprecision, models that include infeasible
behavior or that do not capture all the behavior relevant to
checking a speciﬁcation [68]. Finally, one must contend
with the problem of interpreting model output and equat-
ing it to concrete program output.
Speciﬁed results are usually quite abstract, and the con-
crete test results of a program’s executions may not be repre-
sented in a form that makes checking their equivalence to the
speciﬁed result straightforward. Moreover, speciﬁed results
can be partially represented or oversimpliﬁed. This is why
Gaudel remarked that the existence of a formal speciﬁcation
does not guarantee the existence of a successful test driver
[72]. Formulating concrete equivalence functions may be
necessary to correctly interpret results [118]. In short, solu-
tions to this problem of equivalence across abstraction levels
depend largely on the degree of abstraction and, to a lesser
extent, on the implementation of the system under test.
5D ERIVED TEST ORACLES
A derived test oracle distinguishes a system’s correct from
incorrect behavior based on information derived from vari-
ous artefacts (e.g. documentation, system executions) or
properties of the system under test, or other versions of it.
Testers resort to derived test oracles when speciﬁed test
oracles are unavailable, which is often the case, since speciﬁ-
cations rapidly fall out of date when they exist at all. Of
course, the derived test oracle might become a partial
“speciﬁed test oracle”, so that test oracles derived by the
methods discussed in this section could migrate, over time,
to become, those considered to be the “speciﬁed test
oracles” of the previous section. For example, JWalk incre-
mentally learns algebraic properties of the class under test
[170]. It allows interactive conﬁrmation from the tester,
ensuring that the human is in the “’learning loop”.
The following sections discuss research on deriving test
oracles from development artefacts, beginning in Section 5.1
with pseudo-oracles and N-version programming, which
focus on agreement among independent implementations.
Section 5.2 then introduces metamorphic relations which
focuses on relations that must hold among distinct executions
of a single implementation. Regression testing, Section 5.3,
focuses on relations that should hold across different versions
of the SUT. Approaches for inferring models from system
executions, including invariant inference and speciﬁcation
mining, are described in Section 5.4. Section 5.5 closes with a
discussion of research into extracting test oracle information
from textual documentation, like comments, speciﬁcations,
and requirements.

<!-- Page 9 -->

5.1 Pseudo-Oracles
One of the earliest versions of a derived test oracle is the
concept of a pseudo-oracle, introduced by Davis and
Weyuker [50], as a means of addressing so-called non-test-
able programs:
“Programs which were written in order to deter-
mine the answer in the ﬁrst place. There would be
no need to write such programs, if the correct
answer were known.” [196].
A pseudo-oracle is an alternative version of the program
produced independently, e.g. by a different programming
team or written in an entirely different programming lan-
guage. In our formalism (Section 2), a pseudo-oracle is a test
oracle D that accepts test activity sequences of the form
f1ðxÞo1f2ðxÞo2 : ½f1 6¼ f2 ^ o1 ¼ o2/C138; (1)
where f1;f 2 2 C, the components of the SUT (Section 2),
are alternative, independent ly produced, versions of the
SUT on the same value. We draw the reader’s attention
to the similarity between pseudo-oracles and algebraic
speciﬁcation systems (Sectio n 4.3), like DIASTIS, where
the function composition ex pression in the implementa-
tion language and the term-rewriting expression are
distinct implementations whose output must agree and
form a pseudo-oracle.
A similar idea exists in fault-tolerant computing,
referred to as multi- or N-version programming [13], [14],
where the software is implem ented in multiple ways and
executed in parallel. Where results differ at run-time, a
“voting” mechanism decides which output to use. In our
formalism, an N-version test oracle accepts test activities
of the following form:
f1ðxÞo1f2ðxÞo2 /C1/C1/C1 fkðxÞok :
½8i; j 2½ 1::k/C138;i 6¼ j ) fi 6¼ fj
^ arg maxoi mðoiÞ/C21 t/C138:
(2)
In Equation (2), the outputs form a multiset and m is the
multiplicity, or number of repetitions of an element in the
multiset. The arg max operator ﬁnds the argument that
maximizes a function’s output, here an output with great-
est multiplicity. Finally, the maximum multiplicity is
compared against the threshold t. We can now deﬁne a
N-version test oracle as Dnvðw; xÞ where w obeys Equa-
tion (2) with t bound to x. Then DmajðwÞ¼ Dnvðw; dk
2eÞ is an
N-version oracle that requires a majority of the outputs to
agree and DpsoðwÞ¼ Dnvðw; kÞ generalizes pseudo oracles
to agreement across k implementations.
More recently, Feldt [58] investigated the possibility of
automatically producing different versions using genetic
programming, and McMinn [127] explored the idea of pro-
ducing different software versions for testing through pro-
gram transformation and the swapping of different
software elements with those of a similar speciﬁcation.
5.2 Metamorphic Relations
For the SUT p that implements the function f,a metamorphic
relation is a relation over applications of f that we expect to
hold across multiple executions of p. Suppose fðxÞ¼ ex,
then eae/C0 a ¼ 1 is a metamorphic relation. Under this meta-
morphic relation, p(0.3) /C3 p(-0.3) = 1 will hold if p is
correct [43]. The key idea is that reasoning about the proper-
ties of f will lead us to relations that its implementation p
must obey.
Metamorphic testing is a process of exploiting metamor-
phic relations to generate partial test oracles for follow-up
test cases: it checks important properties of the SUT after
certain test cases are executed [36]. Although metamorphic
relations are properties of the ground truth, the correct phe-
nomenon ( f in the example above) that a SUT seeks to
implement and could be considered a mechanism for creat-
ing speciﬁed test oracles. We have placed them with
derived test oracles, because, in practice, metamorphic rela-
tions are usually manually inferred from a white-box
inspection of a SUT.
Metamorphic relations differ from algebraic speciﬁca-
tions in that a metamorphic relation relates different execu-
tions, not necessarily on the same input, of the same
implementation relative to its speciﬁcation, while algebraic
speciﬁcations equates two distinct implementations of the
speciﬁcation, one written in an implementation language
and the other written in formalism free of implementation
details, usually term rewriting [15].
Under the formalism of Section 2, a metamorphic rela-
tion is
fðx1Þo1fðx2Þo2 /C1/C1/C1 fðikÞok : ½expr ^ k /C21 2/C138;
where expr is a constraint, usually arithmetic, over the
inputs xi and ox. This deﬁnition makes clear that a meta-
morphic relation is a constraint on the values of stimulating
the single SUT f at least twice, observing the responses,
and imposing a constraint on how they interrelate. In con-
trast, algebraic speciﬁcation is a type of pseudo-oracle, as
speciﬁed in Equation (1), which stimulates two distinct
implementations on the same value, requiring their output
to be equivalent.
It is often thought that metamorphic relations need to
concern numerical properties that can be captured by arith-
metic equations, but metamorphic testing is, in fact, more
general. For example, Zhou et al. [209] used metamorphic
testing to test search engines such as Google and Yahoo!,
where the relations considered are clearly non-numeric.
Zhou et al. build metamorphic relations in terms of the con-
sistency of search results. A motivating example they give is
of searching for a paper in the ACM digital library: two
attempts, the second quoted, using advanced search fail,
but a general search identical to the ﬁrst succeeds. Using
this insight, the authors build metamorphic relations, like
ROR : A1 ¼ð A2 [ A3Þ)j A2j/C20j A1j, where the Ai are sets of
web pages returned by queries. Metamorphic testing is also
means of testing Weyuker’s “non-testable programs”, intro-
duced in the last section.
When the SUT is nondeterministic, such as a classiﬁer
whose exact output varies from run to run, deﬁning meta-
morphic relations solely in terms of output equality is usu-
ally insufﬁcient during metamorphic testing. Murphy et al.
[138], [139] investigate relations other than equality, like set
intersection, to relate the output of stochastic machine learn-
ing algorithms, such as classiﬁers. Guderlei and Mayer
BARR ET AL.: THE ORACLE PROBLEM IN SOFTWARE TESTING: A SURVEY 515

<!-- Page 10 -->

introduced statistical metamorphic testing, where the rela-
tions for test output are checked using statistical analysis
[80], a technique later exploited to apply metamorphic test-
ing to stochastic optimisation algorithms [203].
The biggest challenge in metamorphic testing is automat-
ing the discovery of metamorphic relations. Some of those
in the literature are mathematical [36], [37], [42] or combina-
torial [138], [139], [160], [203]. Work on the discovery of
algebraic speciﬁcations [88] and JWalk’s lazy systematic
unit testing, in which the speciﬁcation is lazily, and incre-
mentally, learned through interactions between JWalk
and the developer [170] might be suitable for adaptation to
the discovery metamorphic relations. For instance, the
programmer’s development environment might track rela-
tionships among the output of test cases run during devel-
opment, and propose ones that hold across many runs to
the developer as possible metamorphic relations. Work has
already begun that exploits domain knowledge to formulate
metamorphic relations [38], but it is still at an early stage
and not yet automated.
5.3 Regression Test Suites
Regression testing aims to detect whether the modiﬁcations
made to the new version of a SUT have disrupted existing
functionality [204]. It rests on the implicit assumption
that the previous version can serve as an oracle for existing
functionality.
For corrective modiﬁcations, desired functionality
remains the same so the test oracle for version i, Di, can
serve as the next version’s test oracle, Diþ1. Corrective mod-
iﬁcations may fail to correct the problem they seek to
address or disrupt existing functionality; test oracles may
be constructed for these issues by symbolically comparing
the execution of the faulty version against the newer, alleg-
edly ﬁxed version [79]. Orstra generates assertion-based test
oracles by observing the program states of the previous ver-
sion while executing the regression test suite [199]. The
regression test suite, now augmented with assertions, is
then applied to the newer version. Similarly, spectra-based
approaches use the program and value spectra obtained
from the original version to detect regression faults in the
newer versions [86], [200].
For perfective modiﬁcations, those that add new features
to the SUT, Di must be modiﬁed to cater for newly added
behaviours, i.e. Diþ1 ¼ Di [ DD. Test suite augmentation
techniques specialise in identifying and generating DD [6],
[131], [202]. However, more work is required to develop
these augmentation techniques so that they augment, not
merely the test input, but also the expected output. In this
way, test suite augmentation could be extended to augment
the existing oracles as well as the test data.
Changes in the speciﬁcation, which is deemed to fail to
meet requirements perhaps because the requirements have
themselves changed, drives another class of modiﬁcations.
These changes are generally regarded as “perfective” main-
tenance in the literature but no distinction is made between
perfections that add new functionality to code (without
changing requirements) and those changes that arise due to
changed requirements (or incorrect speciﬁcations).
Our formalisation of test oracles in Section 2 forces a dis-
tinction of these two categories of perfective maintenance,
since the two have profoundly different consequences for
test oracles. We therefore refer to this new category of
perfective maintenance as “changed requirements”. Recall
that, for the function f : X ! Y , domðfÞ¼ X. For changed
requirements:
9a /C1 Diþ1ðaÞ 6¼ DiðaÞ;
which implies, of course, domðDiþ1Þ\ domðDiÞ 6¼; and the
new test oracle cannot simply union the new behavior with
the old test oracle. Instead, we have
Diþ1 ¼ DD if a 2 domðDDÞ
Di otherwise:
/C26
5.4 System Executions
A system execution trace can be exploited to derive test
oracles or to reduce the cost of a human test oracle by align-
ing an incorrect execution against the expected execution,
as expressed in temporal logic [51]. This section discusses
the two main techniques for deriving test oracles from
traces—invariant detection and speciﬁcation mining.
Derived test oracles can be built on both techniques to auto-
matically check expected behaviour similar to assertion-
based speciﬁcation, discussed in Section 4.2.
5.4.1 Invariant Detection
Program behaviours can be automatically checked against
invariants. Thus, invariants can serve as test oracles to help
determine the correct and incorrect outputs.
When invariants are not available for a program in
advance, they can be learned from the program (semi-)
automatically. A well-known technique proposed by Ernst
et al. [56], implemented in the Daikon tool [55], is to execute
a program on a collection of inputs (test cases) against a col-
lection of potential invariants. The invariants are instanti-
ated by binding their variables to the program’s variables.
Daikon then dynamically infers likely invariants from those
invariants not violated during the program executions over
the inputs. The inferred invariants capture program behav-
iours, and thus can be used to check program correctness.
For example, in regression testing, invariants inferred from
the previous version can be checked as to whether they still
hold in the new version.
In our formalism, Daikon invariant detection can deﬁne
an unsound test oracle that gathers likely invariants from
the preﬁx of a testing activity sequence, then enforces those
invariants over its sufﬁx. Let Ij be the set of likely invariants
at observation j; I0 are the initial invariants; for the test
activity sequence r1r2 ... rn, In ¼f x 2 I j8 i 2½ 1::n/C138;r i /C131 xg,
where /C131 is logical entailment. Thus, we take an observation
to deﬁne a binding of the variables in the world under
which a likely invariant either holds or does not: only those
likely invariants remain that no observation invalidates. In
the sufﬁx rnþ1rnþ2 ... rm, the test oracle then changes gear
and accepts only those activities whose response observa-
tions obey In, i.e. ri : ½ri /C131 In/C138;i > n .
Invariant detection can be computationally expensive, so
incremental [22], [171] and light weight static analyses [39],
[63] have been brought to bear. A technical report summa-
rises various dynamic analysis techniques [157]. Model
516 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, VOL. 41, NO. 5, MAY 2015

<!-- Page 11 -->

inference [90], [187] could also be regarded as a form of
invariant generation in which the invariant is expressed as a
model (typically as an FSM). Ratcliff et al. used Search-
Based Software Engineering (SBSE) [84] to search for invari-
ants, guided by mutation testing [153].
The accuracy of inferred invariants depends in part on
the quality and completeness of the test cases; additional
test cases might provide new data from which more accu-
rate invariants can be inferred [56]. Nevertheless, inferring
“perfect” invariants is almost impossible with the current
state of the art, which tends to frequently infer incorrect or
irrelevant invariants [151]. Wei et al. recently leveraged
existing contracts in Eiffel code to infer postconditions on
commands (as opposed to queries) involving quantiﬁcation
or implications whose premises are conjunctions of formu-
lae [192], [193].
Human intervention can, of course, be used to ﬁlter the
resulting invariants, i.e., retaining the correct ones and dis-
carding the rest. However, manual ﬁltering is error-prone
and the misclassiﬁcation of invariants is frequent. In a recent
empirical study, Staats et al. found that half of the incorrect
invariants Daikon inferred from a set of Java programs were
misclassiﬁed [175]. Despite these issues, research on the
dynamic inference of program invariants has exhibited
strong momentum in the recent past with the primary focus
on its application to test generation [10], [141], [207].
5.4.2 Speciﬁcation Mining
Speciﬁcation mining or inference infers a formal model of
program behaviour from a set of observations. In terms of
our formalism, a test oracle can enforce these formal models
over test activities. In her seminal work on using inference
to assess test data adequacy, Weyuker connected inference
and testing as inverse processes [194]. The testing process
starts with a program, and looks for I/O pairs that charac-
terise every aspect of both the intended and actual behav-
iours, while inference starts with a set of I/O pairs, and
derives a program to ﬁt the given behaviour. Weyuker
deﬁned this relation for assessing test adequacy which can
be stated informally as follows.
A set of I/O pairs T is an inference adequate test set for the
program P intended to fulﬁl speciﬁcation S iff the program
IT inferred from T (using some inference procedure) is
equivalent to both P and S. Any difference would imply
that the inferred program is not equivalent to the actual pro-
gram and, therefore, that the test set T used to infer the pro-
gram P is inadequate.
This inference procedure mainly depends upon the set of
I/O pairs used to infer behaviours. These pairs can be
obtained from system executions either passively, e.g., by
runtime monitoring, or actively, e.g., by querying the sys-
tem [105]. However, equivalence checking is undecidable in
general, and therefore inference is only possible for pro-
grams in a restricted class, such as those whose behaviour
can be modelled by ﬁnite state machines [194]. With this,
equivalence can be accomplished by experiment [89]. Nev-
ertheless, serious practical limitations are associated with
such experiments (see the survey by Lee and Yannakakis
[111] for complete discussion).
The marriage between inference and testing has pro-
duced wealth of techniques, especially in the context of
“black-box” systems, when source code/behavioural mod-
els are unavailable. Most work has applied L/C3 , a well-
known learning algorithm, to learn a black-box system B as
a ﬁnite state machine with n states [7]. The algorithm infers
an FSM by iteratively querying B and observing the corre-
sponding outputs. A string distinguishes two FSMs when
only one of the two machines ends in a ﬁnal state upon con-
suming the string. At each iteration, an inferred model Mi
with i<n states is given. Then, the model is reﬁned with
the help of a string that distinguishes B and Mi to produce
a new model, until the number of states reaches n.
Lee and Yannakakis [111] showed how to use L/C3 for con-
formance testing of B with a speciﬁcation S. Suppose L/C3
starts by inferring a model Mi, then we compute a string
that distinguishes Mi from S and reﬁne Mi through the
algorithm. If, for i ¼ n, Mn is S, then we declare B to be cor-
rect, otherwise faulty.
Apart from conformance testing, inference techniques
have been used to guide test generation to focus on particu-
lar system behavior and to reduce the scope of analysis. For
example, Li et al. applied L/C3 to the integration testing of a
system of black-box components [113]. Their analysis archi-
tecture derives a test oracle from a test suite by using L/C3 to
infer a model of the systems from dynamically observing
system’s behavior; this model is then searched to ﬁnd incor-
rect behaviors, such as deadlocks, and used to verify the
system’s behaviour under fuzz testing (Section 6).
To ﬁnd concurrency issues in asynchronous black-box
systems, Groz et al. proposed an approach that extracts
behavioural models from systems through active learning
techniques [78] and then performs reachability analysis on
the models [27] to detect issues, notably races.
Further work in this context has been compiled by Shah-
baz [165] with industrial applications. Similar applications
of inference can be found in system analysis [21], [78], [134],
[188], [189], component interaction testing [114], [121],
regression testing [200], security testing [168] and veriﬁca-
tion [53], [77], [147].
Zheng et al. [208] extract item sets from web search
queries and their results, then apply association rule mining
to infer rules. From these rules, they construct derived test
oracles for web search engines, which had been thought to
be untestable. Image segmentation delineates objects of
interest in an image; implementing segmentation programs
is a tedious, iterative process. Frouchni et al. successfully
apply semi-supervised machine learning to create test
oracles for image segmentation programs [67]. Memon et al.
[132], [133], [198] introduced and developed the GUITAR
tool, which has been evaluated by treating the current ver-
sion of the SUT as correct, inferring the speciﬁcation, and
then executing the generated test inputs. Artiﬁcial Neural
Networks have also been applied to learn system behaviour
and detect deviations from it [162], [163].
The majority of speciﬁcation mining techniques adopt
ﬁnite state machines as the output format to capture the
functional behaviour of the SUT [21], [27], [53], [77], [78],
[89], [111], [113], [134], [147], [165], [168], [189], sometimes
extended with temporal constraints [188] or data constraints
[114], [121] which are, in turn, inferred by Daikon [56].
B€uchi automata have been used to check properties against
black-box systems [147]. Annotated call trees have been

used to represent the program behaviour of different ver-
sions in the regression testing context [200]. GUI widgets
have been directly modelled with objects and properties for
testing [132], [133], [198]. Artiﬁcial Neural Nets and
machine learning classiﬁers have been used to learn the
expected behaviour of SUT [67], [162], [163]. For dynamic
and fuzzy behaviours such as the result of web search
engine queries, association rules between input (query) and
output (search result strings) have been used as the format
of an inferred oracle [208].
5.5 Textual Documentation
Textual documentation ranges from natural language
descriptions of requirements to structured documents detail-
ing the functionalities of APIs. These documents describe the
functionalities expected from the SUT to varying degrees,
and can therefore serve as a basis for generating test oracles.
They are usually informal, intended for other humans, not to
support formal logical or mathematical reasoning. Thus,
they are often partial and ambiguous, in contrast to speciﬁca-
tion languages. Their importance for test oracle construction
rests on the fact that developers are more likely to write them
than formal speciﬁcations. In other words, the documenta-
tion deﬁnes the constraints that the test oracle D, as deﬁned
in Section 2, enforces over testing activities.
At ﬁrst sight, it may seem impossible to derive test
oracles automatically because natural languages are inher-
ently ambiguous and textual documentation is often impre-
cise and inconsistent. The use of textual documentation has
often been limited to humans in practical testing applica-
tions [143]. However, some partial automation can assist the
human in testing using documentation as a source of test
oracle information.
Two approaches have been explored. The ﬁrst category
builds techniques to construct a formal speciﬁcation out of an
informal, textual artefact, such as an informal textual speciﬁ-
cation, user and developer documentation, and even source
code comments. The second restricts a natural language to a
semi-formal fragment amenable to automatic processing.
Next, we present representative examples of each approach.
5.5.1 Converting Text into Speciﬁcations
Prowell and Poore [152] introduced a sequential enumera-
tion method for developing a formal speciﬁcation from an
informal one. The method systematically enumerates all
sequences from the input domain and maps the correspond-
ing outputs to produce an arguably complete, consistent,
and correct speciﬁcation. However, it can suffer from an
exponential explosion in the number of input/output
sequences. Prowell and Poore employ abstraction techni-
ques to control this explosion. The end result is a formal
speciﬁcation that can be transferred into a number of nota-
tions, e.g., state transition systems. A notable beneﬁt of this
approach is that it tends to discover many inconsistent and
missing requirements, making the speciﬁcation more com-
plete and precise.
5.5.2 Restricting Natural Language
Restrictions on a natural language reduce complexities in
its grammar and lexicon and allow the expression of
requirements in a concise vocabulary with minimal ambigu-
ity. This, in turn, eases the interpretation of documents and
makes the automatic derivation of test oracles possible. The
researchers who have proposed speciﬁcation languages
based on (semi-) formal subsets of a natural language are
motivated by the fact that model-based speciﬁcation lan-
guages have not seen wide-spread adoption, and believe
the reason is the inaccessibility their formalism and set-the-
oretic underpinnings to the average programmer.
Schwitter introduced a computer-processable, restricted
natural language called PENG [159]. It covers a strict subset
of standard English with a restricted grammar and a
domain speciﬁc lexicon for content words and predeﬁned
function words. Documents written in PENG can be trans-
lated deterministically into ﬁrst-order predicate logic.
Schwitter et al. [30] provided guidelines for writing test sce-
narios in PENG that can automatically judge the correctness
of program behaviours.
6I MPLICIT TEST ORACLES
An implicit test oracle is one that relies on general, implicit
knowledge to distinguish between a system’s correct and
incorrect behaviour. This generally true implicit knowledge
includes such facts as “buffer overﬂows and segfaults are
nearly always errors”. The critical aspect of an implicit test
oracle is that it requires neither domain knowledge nor a
formal speciﬁcation to implement, and it applies to nearly
all programs.
Implicit test oracle can be built on any procedure that
detects anomalies such as abnormal termination due to a
crash or an execution failure [34], [167]. This is because such
anomalies are blatant faults ; that is, no more information is
required to ascertain whether the program behaved cor-
rectly or not. Under our formalism, an implicit oracle
deﬁnes a subset of stimulus and response relations as
guaranteed failures, in some context.
Implicit test oracles are not universal. Behaviours abnor-
mal for one system in one context may be normal for that
system in a different context or normal for a different sys-
tem. Even crashing may be considered acceptable, or even
desired behaviour, as in systems designed to ﬁnd crashes.
Research on implicit oracles is evident from early work in
software engineering. The very ﬁrst work in this context
was related to deadlock, livelock and race detection to
counter system concurrency issues [24], [106], [185], [16],
[169]. Similarly, research on testing non-functional attrib-
utes have garnered much attention since the advent of the
object-oriented paradigm. In performance testing, system
throughput metrics can highlight degradation errors [120],
[123], as when a server fails to respond when a number of
requests are sent simultaneously. A case study by Weyuker
and Vokolos showed how a process with excessive CPU
usage caused service delays and disruptions [195]. Simi-
larly, test oracles for memory leaks can be built on a proﬁl-
ing technique that detects dangling references during the
run of a program [12], [57], [87], [211]. For example, Xie and
Aiken proposed a boolean constraint system to represent
the dynamically allocated objects in a program [201]. Their
system raises an alarm when an object becomes unreachable
but has not yet been deallocated.

<!-- Page 13 -->

Fuzzing is an effective way to ﬁnd implicit anomalies,
such a crashes [136]. The main idea is to generate random,
or “fuzz”, inputs and feed them to the system to ﬁnd anom-
alies. This works because the implicit speciﬁcation usually
holds over all inputs, unlike explicit speciﬁcations which
tend to relate subsets of inputs to outputs. If an anomaly is
detected, the fuzz tester reports it along with the input
that triggers it. Fuzzing is commonly used to detect security
vulnerabilities, such as buffer overﬂows, memory leaks,
unhandled exceptions, denial of service, etc. [18], [177].
Other work has focused on developing patterns to detect
anomalies. For instance, Ricca and Tonella [154] considered
a subset of the anomalies that Web applications can harbor,
such as navigation problems, hyperlink inconsistencies, etc.
In their empirical study, 60 percent of the web applications
exhibited anomalies and execution failures.
7T HE HUMAN ORACLE PROBLEM
The above sections give solutions to the test oracle problem
when some artefact exists that can serve as the foundation
for either a full or partial test oracle. In many cases, how-
ever, no such artefact exists so a human tester must verify
whether software behaviour is correct given some stimuli.
Despite the lack of an automated test oracle, software engi-
neering research can still play a key role: ﬁnding ways to
reduce the effort that the human tester has to expend in
directly creating, or in being, the test oracle.
This effort is referred to as the Human Oracle Cost [125].
It aims to reduce the cost of human involvement along two
dimensions: 1) writing test oracles and 2) evaluating test
outcomes. Concerning the ﬁrst dimension, the work of
Staats et al. is a representative. They seek to reduce the
human oracle cost by guiding human testers to those parts
of the code they need to focus on when writing test oracles
[173]. This reduces the cost of test oracle construction, rather
than reducing the cost of a human involvement in testing in
the absence of an automated test oracle. Additional recent
work on test oracle construction includes Dodona, a tool
that suggests oracle data to a human who then decides
whether to use it to deﬁne a test oracle realized as a Java
unit test [115]. Dodona infers relations among program vari-
ables during execution, using network centrality analysis
and data ﬂow.
Research that seeks to reduce the human oracle cost
broadly focuses on ﬁnding a quantitative reduction in the
amount of work the tester has to do for the same amount of
test coverage or ﬁnding a qualitative reduction in the work
needed to understand and evaluate test cases.
7.1 Quantitative Human Oracle Cost
Test suites can be unnecessarily large, covering few test goals
in each individual test case. Additionally, the test cases
themselves may be unnecessarily long—for example con-
taining large numbers of method calls, many of which do not
contribute to the overall test case. The goal of quantitative
human oracle cost reduction is to reduce test suite and test case
size so as to maximise the beneﬁt of each test case and each
component of that test case. This consequently reduces the
amount of manual checking effort that is required on behalf
of a human tester performing the role of a test oracle. Cast in
terms of our formalism, quantitative reduction aims to parti-
tion the set of test activity sequences so the human need only
consider representative sequences, while test case reduction
aims to shorten test activity sequences.
7.1.1 Test Suite Reduction
Traditionally, test suite reduction has been applied as a
post-processing step to an existing test suite, e.g. the work
of Harrold et al, [85], Offutt et al. [140] and Rothermel et al.
[156]. Recent work in the search-based testing literature has
sought to combine test input generation and test suite
reduction into one phase to produce smaller test suites.
Harman et al. proposed a technique for generating test
cases that penetrate the deepest levels of the control depen-
dence graph for the program, in order to create test cases
that exercise as many elements of the program as possible
[82]. Ferrer et al. [61] attack a multi-objective version of the
problem in which they sought to simultaneously maximize
branch coverage and minimize test suite size; their focus
was not this problem per se, but its use to compare a num-
ber of multi-objective optimisation algorithms, including
the well-known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
II (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA2), and MOCell.
On a series of randomly-generated programs and small
benchmarks, they found MOCell performed best.
Taylor et al. [178] use an inferred model as a semantic test
oracle to shrink a test suite. Fraser and Arcuri [65] generate
test suites for Java using their EvoSuite tool. By generating the
entire suite at once, they are able to simultaneously maximize
coverage and minimize test suite size, thereby aiding human
oracles and alleviating the human oracle cost problem.
7.1.2 Test Case Reduction
When using randomised algorithms for generating test
cases for object-oriented systems, individual test cases can
generate very long traces very quickly—consisting of a large
number of method calls that do not actually contribute to a
speciﬁc test goal (e.g. the coverage of a particular branch).
Such method calls unnecessarily increase test oracle cost, so
Leitner et al. remove such calls [112] using Zeller’s and
Hildebrandt’s Delta Debugging [206]. JWalk simpliﬁes test
sequences by removing side-effect free functions from
them, thereby reducing test oracle costs where the human is
the test oracle [170]. Quick tests seek to efﬁciently spend a
small test budget by building test suites whose execution is
fast enough for it to be run after compilations [76]. These
quick tests must be likely to trigger bugs and therefore gen-
erate short traces, which, as a result, are easier for humans
to comprehend.
7.2 Qualitative Human Oracle Cost
Human oracle costs may also be minimised from a qualita-
tive perspective. That is, the extent to which test cases, more
generally testing activities, may be easily understood and
processed by a human. The input proﬁle of a SUT is the dis-
tribution of inputs it actually processes when running in its
operational environment. Learning an input proﬁle requires
domain knowledge. If such domain knowledge is not built
into the test data generation process, machine-generated
test data tend to be drawn from a different distribution over
BARR ET AL.: THE ORACLE PROBLEM IN SOFTWARE TESTING: A SURVEY 519

<!-- Page 14 -->

the SUT’s inputs than its input proﬁle. While this may be
beneﬁcial for trapping certain types of faults, the utility of
the approach decreases when test oracle costs are taken into
account, since the tester must invest time comprehending the
scenario represented by test data in order to correctly evalu-
ate the corresponding program output. Arbitrary inputs are
much harder to understand than recognisable pieces of
data, thus adding time to the checking process.
All approaches to qualitatively alleviating the human
oracle cost problem incorporate human knowledge to
improve the understandability of test cases. The three
approaches we cover are
1) augmenting test suites designed by the developers;
2) computing “realistic” inputs from web pages, web
services, and natural language; and
3) mining usage patterns to replicate them in the test
cases.
In order to improve the readability of automatically-gen-
erated test cases, McMinn et al. propose the incorporation
of human knowledge into the test data generation process
[125]. With search-based approaches, they proposed inject-
ing this knowledge by “seeding” the algorithm with test
cases that may have originated from a human source such
as a “sanity check” performed by the programmer, an
already existing, partial test suite, or input–output examples
generated by programming paradigms that involve the
developer in computation, like prorogued programming [2].
The generation of string test data is particularly problem-
atic for automatic test data generators, which tend to gener-
ate nonsensical strings. These nonsensical strings are, of
course, a form of fuzz testing (Section 6) and good for
exploring uncommon, shallow code paths and ﬁnding cor-
ner cases, but they are unlikely to exercise functionality
deeper in a program’s control ﬂow. This is because string
comparisons in control expressions are usually stronger
than numerical comparisons, making one of a control
point’s branches much less likely to traverse via uniform
fuzzing. We see here the seminal computer science trade-off
between breadth ﬁrst and depth ﬁrst search in the choice
between fuzz testing with nonsensical inputs and testing
with realistic inputs.
Bozkurt and Harman, introduced the idea of mining
web services for realistic test inputs, using the outputs
of known and trusted test services as more realistic
inputs to the service under test [32]. The idea is that real-
istic test cases are more likely to reveal faults that devel-
opers care about and yield test cases that are more
readily understood. McMinn et al. also mine the web for
realistic test cases. They proposed mining strings from
the web to assist in the test generation process [129],
[166]. Since web page content is generally the result of
human effort, the strings contained therein tend to be
real words or phrases with high degrees of semantic and
domain relevant context that can thus be used as sources
of realistic test data.
Afshan et al. [1] combine a natural language model and
metahueristics, strategies that guide a search process [25], to
help generate readable strings. The language model scores
how likely a string is to belong to a language based on the
character combinations. Incorporating this probability score
into a ﬁtness function, a metaheuristic search can not only
cover test goals, but generate string inputs that are more
comprehensible than the arbitrary strings generated by the
previous state of the art. Over a number of case studies,
Afshan et al. found that human oracles more accurately and
more quickly evaluated their test strings.
Fraser and Zeller [66] improve the familiarity of test cases
by mining the software under test for common usage pat-
terns of APIs. They then seek to replicate these patterns in
generated test cases. In this way, the scenarios generated
are more likely to be realistic and represent actual usages of
the software under test.
7.3 Crowdsourcing the Test Oracle
A recent approach to handling the lack of a test oracle is to
outsource the problem to an online service to which large
numbers of people can provide answers—i.e., through
crowdsourcing. Pastore et al. [146] demonstrated the feasi-
bility of the approach but noted problems in presenting the
test problem to the crowd such that it could be easily under-
stood, and the need to provide sufﬁcient code documenta-
tion so that the crowd could determine correct outputs from
incorrect ones. In these experiments, crowdsourcing was
performed by submitting tasks to a generic crowdsourcing
platform—Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. 4 However, some
dedicated crowdsourcing services now exist for the testing
of mobile applications. They speciﬁcally address the prob-
lem of the exploding number of devices on which a mobile
application may run, and which the developer or tester may
not own, but which may be possessed by the crowd at large.
Examples of these services include Mob4Hire, 5 MobTest6
and uTest.7
8F UTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSION
This paper has provided a comprehensive survey of test
oracles, covering speciﬁed, derived and implicit oracles and
techniques that cater for the absence of test oracles. The
paper has also analyzed publication trends in the test oracle
domain. This paper has necessarily focused on the tradi-
tional approaches to the test oracle problem. Much work on
test oracles remains to be done. In addition to research
deepening and interconnecting these approaches, test oracle
problem is open to new research directions. We close with a
discussion of two of these that we ﬁnd noteworthy and
promising: test oracle reuse and test oracle metrics.
As this survey has shown, test oracles are difﬁcult to con-
struct. Oracle reuse is therefore an important problem that
merits attention. Two promising approaches to oracle reuse
are generalizations of reliable reset and the sharing of oracular
data across software product lines (SPLs). Generalizing reli-
able reset to arbitrary states allows the interconnection of dif-
ferent versions of a program, so we can build test oracles that
based on older versions of a program, using generalized reli-
able reset to ignore or handle new inputs and functionality.
SPLs are sets of related versions of a system [47]. A product

line can be thought of as a tree of related software products in
which branches contain new alternative versions of the sys-
tem, each of which shares some core functionality enjoyed by
a base version. Research on test oracles should seek to lever-
age these SPL trees to deﬁne trees of test oracles that share
oracular data where possible.
Work has already begun on using test oracle as the mea-
sure of how well the program has been tested (a kind of test
oracle coverage) [103], [176], [186] and measures of oracles
such as assessing the quality of assertions [158]. More work
is needed. “Oracle metrics” is a challenge to, and an oppor-
tunity for, the “software metrics” community. In a world in
which test oracles become more prevalent, it will be impor-
tant for testers to be able to assess the features offered by
alternative test oracles.
