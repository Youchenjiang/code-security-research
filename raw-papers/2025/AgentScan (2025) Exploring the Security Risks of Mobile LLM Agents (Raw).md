we identify 11 distinct attack surfaces that span the entire

dation for systematic threat modeling and security evaluation

in this emerging field.

Using AgentScan , we empirically validated the feasibility

and impact of a wide range of attacks in real-world settings.

Our evaluation of 9 widely deployed mobile LLM agents re-

veals a troubling landscape: all agents exhibit vulnerabilities

to targeted attacks , with varying levels of exposure across

interaction layers. Most notably, UI manipulation attacks

are universally effective —every tested agent fails to defend

against Transparent Overlay and Pop-up Interference attacks,

which can lead to behavioral deviation, privacy leakage, or

full execution hijacking. These findings expose fundamental

design flaws in current agent implementations and underscore

the urgent need for security-aware development practices in the

rapidly evolving ecosystem of LLM-powered mobile agents.

We have reported our findings to the relevant vendors through

responsible disclosure. At the time of writing, two OEMs

have responded with acknowledgment and appreciation of our

research contributions.

A. Mobile LLM Agents

developers are actively deploying mobile LLM agents. Based

on implementation architecture, we categorize current mobile

LLM agents into three primary types:

System-level Agents are developed and maintained by

OEMs, featuring tight integration with the underlying oper-

ating system and elevated execution privileges. These agents

often access proprietary system APIs and leverage optimized

resource scheduling to deliver high performance. Their direct

access to privileged services and internal interfaces allows

seamless UI manipulation without relying on the Android

accessibility framework [23]. Representative examples include

Honor YOYO Assistant [8] and Vivo Blue Heart Assis-

tant [24], both of which are pre-installed with system-level

trust and benefit from deep OS-level integration.

Third-party Universal Agents are deployed as regular An-

droid applications and operate under the standard permission

and sandboxing model. These agents prioritize cross-device

compatibility and rely primarily on public Android APIs [25]

and the accessibility framework to simulate user interac-

employing this strategy rely on hand-crafted rules or hard-

coded workflows to perform specific tasks. In such cases, the

LLM is used primarily for input parsing or intent recognition,

while the actual decision-making is handled by predefined

templates or scripts. This approach is particularly favored by

system-level agents, where stability, repeatability, and minimal

risk are paramount.

LLM-Centric Reasoning. In contrast, some agents adopt

a flexible decision-making strategy driven by the LLM at

each step. These agents analyze the current UI state and

dynamically determine the next action without relying on

predefined flows, enabling better generalization to novel tasks.

This approach is common in academic or exploratory sys-

tems, where adaptability is prioritized. To improve decision

bypassing the need for UI navigation. Others mimic user

behavior by returning to the home screen and tapping the

deployments.

Native Input Simulation: System-level agents often invoke

After each action, agents perform reflection to assess

whether the intended effect was achieved, enabling robustness

against UI changes and execution errors. Typically, the agent

submits the updated screen state—via screenshots or view

hierarchies—along with the original goal to the LLM, which

determines whether the state transition meets expectations.

To aid this process, some agents compare UI states before

and after actions, generating structured diffs or graphs to

highlight relevant changes. This feedback helps the model

reason about action outcomes and adjust subsequent deci-

sions. Finally, in the task completion phase, the agent verifies

whether the overall goal has been satisfied. If not, the model

may trigger corrective actions or continue execution until the

task is complete.

malicious prompts, we applied a set of social engineering

strategies—including Fake Consent , Gamification , Authority

Bias , Emergency Simulation , and Role-Playing Trap —to it-

eratively optimize the basic instructions. This design was

inspired by established prompt-based manipulation techniques

from prior works [60], [61], [62], [63]. The final Malicious

Instruction for Agent dataset reflects a spectrum from benign-

looking to highly deceptive instructions, allowing us to evalu-

ate how easily the agent can be misled. We then verify whether

the agent follows these instructions without additional user

confirmation. Detailed Malicious Instructions are provided

in Table VI in appendix.

2) Glitch Tokens. : In addition to prompt semantics, we

also evaluate agent robustness to anomalous token inputs.

Specifically, we replicate the Glitch Token attack scenario

proposed by Li et al. [41], where special malformed token

sequences can destabilize the model’s reasoning. We selected

10 representative glitch tokens from the original study and

embedded them into our baseline instruction set, creating

hybrid adversarial prompts. These test cases allow us to

observe whether the presence of glitch tokens causes the

agent to misinterpret instructions, fail to complete the task,

or even exhibit unsafe behavior. We verify whether the agent

remains functionally correct and whether it can still complete

the intended task objectives. The full list of glitch tokens used

in our tests is provided in Table VII in appendix.

3) Viewtree Interference. : This attack exploits the agent’s

reliance on the Android view hierarchy (ViewTree) for lo-

cating and interacting with UI elements. Many agents use

structural attributes from the viewtree—such as resource-

id , class , and bounds —to determine which components to

interact with. When the structure is altered through overlays,

the agent may fail to recognize intended targets or interact

with the wrong elements.

We created a floating window with screen focus using the

TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY flag, which dynamically

injects a new layer into the viewtree at runtime. This overlay

introduces additional top-level UI nodes, effectively masking

or shifting the original view hierarchy. We selected 10 basic

instructions and executed them across all tested agents. During

task execution, the interfering overlay was introduced at the

moment the agent parsed the viewtree or prepared to act. We

then monitored whether the agent’s behavior changed—for

example, failing to locate a button, clicking on an unintended

item, or aborting the task due to missing target components.

4) Prompt Injection via Display. : This attack targets the

agent’s LLM-based reasoning pipeline by introducing mislead-

ing textual content directly into the visual interface. Unlike UI

element spoofing that manipulates icon appearance or layout,

this method aims to interfere with the agent’s internal decision-

making by altering the language context presented on-screen.

We design a set of adversarial prompts that simulate deceptive

user instructions and display them using FLAG_NOT_FO-

“Send,” “Submit,” or app icons), such that when the agent

performs a coordinate-based click, the input is captured by

the invisible overlay rather than the intended UI element. This

allows redirection to an attacker-controlled activity or content.

We randomly selected 10 basic tasks for testing and injected

the overlay just before the agent was expected to perform its

action. If the click is redirected and the agent reaches our

confirmation interface (e.g., launching a “pwned” activity), the

attack is deemed successful. The agent’s inability to detect or

adapt to this invisible obstruction highlights the risk of relying

on naive input simulation.

mimics the package name of a legitimate app. When the agent

attempts to launch the intended app, the intent resolves to the

attacker-controlled clone instead. We created forged versions

of two third-party apps (WeChat and Google Maps) and one

pre-installed system app (Clock). After replacing the original

apps, we instructed the agent to perform app-launch tasks

• Privacy Leakage : User privacy data (e.g., credentials,

contact lists, password in the agent’s memory) or agent

operational context (e.g., instructions, screen states) are

captured.

Poisoned CoT. As shown in Table III, Malicious In-

structions and Glitch Tokens poison the CoT in LLMs by

directly modifying the input tokens. thereby compromising

the core LLM Processor of the agent and causing unintended

operations. Prompt Injection via Display exploits the inherent

characteristic of agents requiring raw GUI data for decision

generation, where adversarial tokens are embedded to disrupt

the CoT of LLM Processor . When attackers successfully

poison the LLM’s CoT, they can orchestrate arbitrarily se-

vere consequences. For example, by attacking AppAgent, we

achieved unauthorized restore factory settings operations on

our test device.

Task Interruption. Viewtree Interference can easily cause

Task Interruption, because modifying the top-layer ViewTree

structure may alter the agent’s critical information sources,

thus disrupting its normal operation. Attackers can disrupt

agent operations by preventing the GUI Collector from

forgery and Deeplink forgery. Moreover, whether through

Transparent overlays or Pop-up Interference, the root cause

of activity hijacking remains consistent: Before operation

triggering (e.g., tap), the GUI Collector fails to detect on-

screen components that obstruct intended operations, ulti-

mately causing interactions with attacker’s elements. Also,

Attackers forge UI elements or App icons, causing the agent

to capture misleading visual information. This consistently

deceives the agent’s LLM processor into interacting with

the counterfeit components, resulting in the hijacking of

the current activity. Large-scale testing has demonstrated the

alarming prevalence of applications vulnerable to Activity Hi-

jacking [52]. Successful attacks frequently redirect victims to

phishing interfaces [51]. In our experiments, the compromised

agent continued operating post-redirection, where the spoofed

interface could further misguide the agent, potentially leading

to severe consequences such as obtaining bank card passwords

which is shown in § VI-D2.

Privacy Leakage. For Privacy Leakage, Deeplink Forgery

remains an effective attack vector. The query parameters

within deeplink requests often contain unprotected sensitive

data (e.g., search keywords, locations), exposing the privacy

risk in App Launcher . Finally, in the Data Pipeline , there

is a risk of being monitored by log listening, which can lead

to the leakage of agent operational context and user privacy

data including screen states and click coordinates obtained

security challenges in current implementations and emphasize

the urgent need for standardized security practices. As LLM-
